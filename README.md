# Linear-Regression-Python-Practice
This practice uses a dataset with company costs (research and development, management, and marketing) and profits.

The practice starts with verifying the correlation between the independent and dependent variables. Next, the data is split into training and testing sets and adequately scaled. A linear regression model is trained with all independent variables in the sequence. This way, it is possible to verify which independent variables are statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) to the model. Some residual analyses are performed, and then a second model with only the statistically significant independent variables is created and trained. Some performance metrics are calculated, and a comparative graph with the real and estimated profit values is generated.
